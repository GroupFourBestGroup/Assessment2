completed the basic number tests from the example testing chart. as the outcome is dependent on system properties the acceptance mentioned that one of the flags was working and that it technically met the requirements of the bug.

@everyone As per discussion regards the friday online hook up experiment 1.. I am available all day, Personal preference is mornings; ideally 12-1 would be for lunch but i can fast-lunch at my desk if that timeslot is needed, iirc @adamashford  && @kat_angel  have lectures 1-3, so a 2 hour slot either side of that seems most logical?

kat_angel [11:11 AM] 
so 11-12 then 4-5?

marcchapman [11:12 AM] 
sorry i meant either or, so 2 hours before or 2 hours after, assuming we are using a 2 hour slot as default

[11:13]  
give or take a coffee break between for those of you timetabled 103

[11:13]  
1-3

kat_angel [11:23 AM] 
gotcha! then either 10-12 or 4-6, depending what people prefer? I guess I'd vote mornings but I can go with whatever

looks good! does the plug in link up with the board somehow?

daical [12:34 PM] 
@kat_angel  Yeah im linking it now, we all need to add it to our browser addon to integrate it

kat_angel [12:34 PM] 
cool, thanks

[12:35]  
I was also wondering if sprint #2 is missing some issues - have the designers and testers recorded what they're currently working on? even if there's no issue number in terms of rapidjson I just figured it would be useful for the write-up

About this Add-on
Scrum for Trello adds functionality to the awesome trello.com  for use in Scrum projects.

Add estimates or record time-spent directly on Trello cards. Shows sums at the top of each list and the top right corner of each board.

To use, simply open a Trello card click the title of the card to edit it. There are buttons with Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...etc.) to let you quickly add an estimate. You can also type in the estimate or the time-spent. To type an estimate, just surround it in parentheses like this: (4) to type the amount of time-spent, put that in square brackets like this: [2]. Those numbers can appear anywhere in the title, but a common convention is to put the estimate at the beginning of the card and the time-spent at the end, like this: "(8) Create Firefox Extension [4.5]". Decimal numbers are accepted for both values.

daical [12:47 PM] 
The burn down chart is now a full working system as i have paid for it full membership

kat_angel [12:47 PM] 
thanks @daical

[12:47]  
can we just google the extension to use it?

----- Yesterday March 31st, 2017 -----
marcchapman [9:33 AM] 
Ive been tinkering with trello, can you guys see the extra boards ive created automatically? i have created a test board and a product backlog board

daical [9:48 AM] 
@marcchapman hi Marc no cannot see it

marcchapman [9:50 AM] 
morning :slightly_smiling_face:  oh well... bleargh... *wanders off to fix it*

[9:52]  
ok, and fixed, seems to be an odd quirk, board says team visible

marcchapman [9:52 AM] 
shrugs

marcchapman [9:53 AM] 
ok, so heres the thinking, since the burndown thing works slightly oddly with trello (or maybe not but documentation sucks)

daical [9:54 AM] 
Still not seen

marcchapman [9:55 AM] 
each sprint needs its own board, and each team needs its own copy of the 'card' for each issue, which kind of makes sense, since each role has different checklists

daical [9:55 AM] 
I am on mobile IOS

marcchapman [9:55 AM] 
click on boards, to see if you have more boards listed

daical [9:55 AM] 
Time to boot up pc

marcchapman [9:56 AM] 
ahh, dont know how stuff interacts with mobile, could present issues i guess, even tho it shouldnt

kat_angel [10:00 AM] 
morning! I'll log into Trello and see if I can see it

marcchapman [10:00 AM] 
@daical  you werent added to the trello 'team' you were just added to the single board, that has now been fixed

[10:01]  
created a new board 'can you see this' if you can, that would be cool, if not i have to remember to add people to the boar as its created

adamashford [10:03 AM] 
I can't see "can you see this"

kat_angel [10:04 AM] 
me neither. I can see Sprint03, Test01, the assignment board and the product backlog

adamashford [10:05 AM] 
I can only see sprints 1-4

marcchapman [10:06 AM] 
@kat_angel  i have made you admin, can you recheck?

kat_angel [10:06 AM] 
sure! I'll log out and in again just to be certain

marcchapman [10:07 AM] 
if that fails then it would appear that this is an 'upgrade' feature that requires payment, or just a reminder that board creators need to add team members on board creation, which works fine for now, but requires a mental note for future reference

kat_angel [10:08 AM] 
uploaded this image: I have this:
Add Comment

kat_angel [10:08 AM] 
so I think it might be an upgrade thing?

marcchapman [10:08 AM] 
oh well, worth a try

[10:10]  
reasoning here is that burndownfortrello works well, but requires a slight shift in how we work with trello, since you can move entire lists as well as individual cards between boards and lists the solution is relatively simple

daical [10:12 AM] 
i CAN SEE THEM IN msc Computer Science

adamashford [10:12 AM] 
Ah.

[10:12]  
Found them

marcchapman [10:14 AM] 
It requires manual setting when you create a board use the menu to add team members, trivial step considering the volume of time project management takes overall

kat_angel [10:15 AM] 
Mine looks the same. Am I looking in the wrong place? I've got sprints 1-4, the backlog and the assignment board

marcchapman [10:16 AM] 
thats fine the 'can you see this' was a test board, i'll remove, now i know what the score is

[10:17]  
I'll look at daryls trello tutorial and adjust it

kat_angel [10:18 AM] 
sure thing! I have the trello for scrum extension in. will everyone need to set up the points individually or can we get them all done and everyone can see the current state of play once the extension is added?

[10:18]  
if that makes sense

marcchapman [10:19 AM] 
the plugin is shared the same as the board, if you checkout the sprint03 board which is currently just a sample board i'm testing with, you should see some added info

kat_angel [10:21 AM] 
cool, will do

I am allocating (for now) 8 hours of work per task, apart from testing, since testing is a little different; They need to do 2 stints one before coding and one after.

[10:27]  
All roles also need custom checklists (makes it easier when creating new cards)

kat_angel [10:28 AM] 
is sprint 03 the current board? I think I might need to add to it

marcchapman [10:29 AM] 
no, current board is still Softeng Assignment 2

kat_angel [10:31 AM] 
do you want me to have a look at adding story points for the current issues on that board?

daical [10:33 AM] 
Hello all adam and I are in the chat conference linked

[10:33]  
join the room

marcchapman [10:34 AM] 
no camera or microphone.

daical [10:35 AM] 
what time are we all on conference

marcchapman [10:36 AM] 
@kat_angel  i have added some arbitrary points that currently i envision as 'hours' but i am still learning here, also the non paid version of burndown only uses hours

kat_angel [10:36 AM] 
that's fine, I was working in hours originally

[10:37]  
think my camera might not pick up much since I put a sticker over it

[10:38]  
also where does the microphone live?

daical [10:38 AM] 
Adam and I have aborted Video conference

kat_angel [10:39 AM] 
sorry about that! I don't think we can really do a virtual stand-up without the rest of the team, anyways

daical [10:39 AM] 
Thats Ok

[10:40]  
:+1:

adamashford [10:40 AM] 
We can write about it in the report anyway.


kat_angel [10:40 AM] 
is there anything else pressing we need to discuss? if not, I figured I'd try and troubleshoot the code some more and check back here periodically.

marcchapman [10:41 AM] 
not sure how well vid conferencing works for groups larger than 2-3, and kat also makes a good point, tbh 4/7 turnout is probably decent for first try :stuck_out_tongue:


daical [10:41 AM] 
Upto Marc

marcchapman [10:42 AM] 
I actually thought the idea was do allocate this time to doing the work anyway, with the channel here for live feedback and updates for the period specified, rather than really a meeting or conference


kat_angel [10:43 AM] 
ok, cool. in that case I'll be AFK while I troubleshoot the code some more. I'll check back in a little while

@daryl @daical @adamashford  in #codespam  there is a sample file to output a string to a json file and a link to a validator

chelsloren [6:56 PM] 
hey guys, sorry i didnt join in earlier. I have completed my tasks for this sprint, do I need to add what ive done and how long I worked on it for as a comment anywhere in trello? Or would a checklist be better to show what ive done? I will also update my board to add the files for the programmers and testers to view.

[6:58]  
also would it be beneficial to add each sprint like the one that has currently been developed for sprint 3 on trello? if so, I don't mind creating it


----- Today April 1st, 2017 -----
marcchapman [8:39 AM] 
@chelsloren   currently the SoftEng Assignment 2 board is still the main trello board. i have moved the #836 card from product backlog to the sprint #2 list, i intend to make amendments to @daryl  trello tutorial later on to describe how the new (hopefully improved) workflow changes are handled.

marcchapman [8:50 AM] 
Given that we have further developed working practices from previous weeks, as well as the discovery of burndownfortrello by david, i am thinking there were 2 options, 1) for each issue make 3 cards, one per role, with individual role based checklists 2) create one card per issue with a larger multi role checklist, or multiple checklists. Each have their pros and cons, the biggest con being that we are running short sprints, so each issue can run across sprints especially across roles. So it seems to me that each role should create a card just for its own task.
